## General Information
- build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

## Conclusions
- Seborrheic keratosis is having the lowest distribution.
- Pigmented Benign keratosis, melanoma and basal cell carcinoma are having the highest distribution of data
- We see much improvements with respect to accuracy from the model after Building & training on the rectified class imbalance data.
- We see Training accuracy gained 95% and Validation accuracy gained 78%.
